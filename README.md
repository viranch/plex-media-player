## Building

You need:

* Qt 5.6 (on OSX and windows it will be automatically downloaded when you run CMake)
* cmake 3.1 or newer
* ninja is recommended for building
* FFmpeg 3.x and mpv from github

## Building on Mac OS X

Configure

If you're happy just building from the command line then run CMake for the ninja build tool:

* Install ninja with homebrew:
  * ``brew install ninja``
* Install mpv and other dependencies with homebrew:
  * ``brew install mpv --with-shared --HEAD``
* ``mkdir build ; cd build``
* ``cmake -GNinja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=output ..``

Build (ninja):

* ``ninja``

Make a distributable package:

* ``ninja install`` (be patient, it's slow)

Or if you prefer working in Xcode, run CMake for the xcode build):

* ``mkdir build ; cd build``
* ``cmake -GXcode ..``

## Building on Linux

### Using the Qt 5.6 release

It is possible to use a pre-built Qt 5.6 from http://download.qt.io/official_releases/qt/5.6/. Just download and install one of the linux-x64 packages. If your distro packages this version, you might be able to use that. Keep in mind that Qt 5.5 or older will not work properly.

### Building Qt 5.6.0

You'll want to grab one of the Qt 5.6.0 (or later) packages from http://download.qt.io/ and unpack it locally. On Fedora, even with a working development environment set up, the following packages were necessary to successfully build Qt (and QtWebEngine):

``sudo dnf install libxcb libxcb-devel libXrender libXrender-devel xcb-util-wm xcb-util-wm-devel xcb-util xcb-util-devel xcb-util-image xcb-util-image-devel xcb-util-keysyms xcb-util-keysyms-devel libcap-devel snappy-devel libsrtp-devel nss-devel pciutils-devel gperf``

(The majority of the packages on this list came from http://code.qt.io/cgit/qt/qtbase.git/tree/src/plugins/platforms/xcb/README, but everything after xcb-util-keysyms-devel was trial-and-error in attempts build QtWebEngine; this list of packages may not be complete, but hopefully it provides a useful starting point.)

Once you've unpacked the Qt 5.6.0 package:

* ``cd qt-everywhere-opensource-src-5.6.0``
* ``./configure -confirm-license -opensource``
* ``make``
* ``sudo make install``
* ``cd qtwebengine``
* ``qmake``
* ``make``
* ``sudo make install``

That should do it for Qt. It's worth noting that, on a Core i7-950 with 24GB of RAM, this took more than three hours to build. Also, you can prefix `./configure` with a [make](http://linux.die.net/man/1/make) flag definition such as "`MAKEFLAGS="-j$(nproc)"`", where `nproc` is the number of parallel builds desired. This will significantly speed up compile time. It is [suggested](http://www.makelinux.net/books/lkd2/ch02lev1sec3) to use a number 1 to 2x the # of cores you have. For more, also see [this article](http://www.math-linux.com/linux/tip-of-the-day/article/speedup-gnu-make-build-and-compilation-process).

Example:
```
MAKEFLAGS="-j$(nproc)" ./configure -confirm-license -opensource
```

### Building mpv

mpv is a bit easier to build than Qt, and compiles much faster.

Before you attempt to build mpv, make sure you have the required dependencies installed: https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv#compilation
Some optional dependencies like ALSA or PulseAudio support are required for proper operation of Plex Media Player.

* ``git clone git://github.com/mpv-player/mpv``
* ``cd mpv``
* ``./bootstrap.py``
* ``./waf configure --enable-libmpv-shared``
* ``./waf build``
* ``sudo ./waf install``

### Finally! Building plex-media-player

Assuming that everything else has installed correctly, building Plex Media Player should now be fairly straightforward:

* ``git clone git://github.com/plexinc/plex-media-player``
* ``cd plex-media-player``
* ``mkdir build``
* ``cd build``
* ``cmake -GNinja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DQTROOT=/usr/local/Qt-5.6.0 -DMPV_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/include/mpv -DMPV_LIBRARY=/usr/local/lib/libmpv.so.1 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=output ..``
* ``ninja-build``

You may have to adjust the path passed to `-DQTROOT`. If you use your distro's Qt, omit this argument.

Once ninja-build completes successfully, you should have a usable ``./src/plexmediaplayer`` binary. Run it and test it out! If it works as you expect, you should be able to run ``sudo install ./src/plexmediaplayer ./src/pmphelper /usr/local/bin`` so that the program is usable from anywhere on the system.
